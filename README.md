Halftime voice chat for discord when playing 10 man 5v5's for csgo/cs2 since they removed halftime voicechat.

How to use:
1.) Create a discord developer account and create a new bot and give it adminstrator priveleges and then copy the token (DO NOT SHARE THIS)
Invite the bot to your discord server
2.) In your discord you need to copy your server id by right click your server name and copying. 
3.) Paste the server id into guild id
4.) Copy the voice channel where you want halftime chat to be and paste this in the Destination ID
5.) Copy Voice channel 1 for team 1 and paste for channel 1
6.) Repeat for Voice channel 2 for team 2.
7.) Run the code! and test it out

- When you press the key 'o' you will save user data this isnt necessary to do but it makes the bot work faster
- When you press 'k' it bring everyone to the destination voice channel where you can interact for 15s (the code is a bit delayed by 10 seconds because of 
discords request so press it accordingly.) After 15 seconds the code will automatically bring everyone back to their channels they were in originally.
- When you press 'j' it brings everyone to the destination server until you press j again. this is so you can talk in between matches or when you're just done competeting.
